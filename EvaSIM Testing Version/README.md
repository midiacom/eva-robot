# EvaSIM Installation Instructions
 
In order to facilitate the use of EvaSIM, we managed to package the software with all its dependencies, without having to download and install Python modules. I did it in two versions, one for Windows and one for Linux. To run EvaSIM we recommend **Windows 10** and Linux distributions **Ubuntu 20.04.4** and Linux **Mint 20.3**.
 
First, you must download the correct version for your system.
 
## EvaSIM (Windows Version): [EvaSIM-Windows.zip](https://1drv.ms/u/s!As9IqnfIu5behqh3t5cZMVM_YV7efA?e=mmSPFC)

 
## EvaSIM (Linux Version): [EvaSIM-Linux.zip](https://1drv.ms/u/s!As9IqnfIu5behqh4F7Z609eFUBvKcg?e=Hrdxej)

 
After downloading the zip file, you must unzip it.
 
So, you will see an *"eva_sim"* folder. 
 
Enter the *“eva_sim”* folder and double-click on the *"eva_sim.exe"* file, in the case of the Windows version, or the *"eva_sim"* file, in the case of the Linux version.
 
Now, activate the simulator using the EvaSIM **"Power On"** button.
 
If you hear a greeting, everything should be working correctly!
 
** In case the previous versions didn't work, or you use a linux based RPM package, as in the case of the Fedora distribution, you can try to install the modules through the terminal and run the simulator using the source code. The source code, also in two flavors, is available through this link:

. 
** You must use this document with installation instructions: https://github.com/midiacom/eva-robot/blob/master/EvaSIM%20Testing%20Version/EvaSIM%20-%20Installing%20Instructions%20-%20Appendix%20A.pdf
